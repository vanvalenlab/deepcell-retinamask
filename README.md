# DeepCell-RetinaMask

`deepcell-retinamask` is a deep learning library for building RetinaNet and RetinaMask based object detection models with `tensorflow` and `deepcell-tf`.

This project was heavily influenced by [keras-retinanet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet) and [keras-maskrcnn](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-maskrcnn).
